"Bertha's Mission is to improve life through knowledge and information exchange. For more than 25 years we are innovating solutions that have a direct measurable impact on our customers' daily lives by helping them discover new products or make better informed purchases using unstructured data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computational social science principles. When Bertha’s Technology Works, you can experience breakthrough innovation - all backed with the industry’s most rigorous proven results. The Opportunity is for your complete benefit and satisfaction: working closely with a team whose expertise spans across research tools, computer vision, NLU/ML, and Machine Learning, who seek excellence not only as software engineers but also businesspeople whose mission is to build lasting relationships with every detail of every project. At the heart of their collaborative endeavor, they pursue intellectual excellence in building products and providing services of cutting-edge NLP capabilities.

You will contribute to tasks spanning from initial conception to product delivery focusing on various Natural Language Processing concepts and techniques in the domain of NTD and Digital Customer Satisfaction. You possess the ability to implement new technologies in an agile development environment, with regular opportunity to expand into further disciplines, within the company based on individual and collective customer needs at hand. A keen interest in applying research methods creatively while remaining pragmatic to avoid friction between applied engineering approaches to solve complex problems and business needs, demonstrates creative problem solving abilities and provides insight into how best to tackle new ideas that may become commercial offerings in near future. The candidate should be highly motivated with the ability to work very hands-on in developing state-of-the-art algorithms to advance Bertha technology.

Knowledge & Skills Required:
Deep understanding in various aspects of NLP: entity extraction, topic modeling and document clustering as well as the various topics where these areas are explored, such as Information Retrieval and Dialogue. Experience with other ML related domains is desirable

 An aptitude towards advanced programming (e.g. python, Julia, etc.) skills, a strong sense of ownership towards technical results, and excellent teamwork spirit. Excellent written communication and presentation skills, along with an ability to present highly relevant or technically interesting research findings both verbally and in writing."

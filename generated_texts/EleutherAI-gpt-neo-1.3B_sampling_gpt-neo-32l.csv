We are working with real world text that will enable smart search. Our goal is to make Amazon search useful for all its customers not only Amazon’s own ESLP initiatives focused on Smart Order Experience but also enabling future orders on any other major e-Commerce platforms by including Natural Language Understanding (NLP). At the same time we want them to be an amazing partner helping us build and run high performance ML systems and service for AWS in order to be ready for our next step of transform them from a research prototype to production. This requires that we continue inventing on behalf team members as well as building up new systems along the way with cutting-edge technology, state of art artificial intelligence, NLP methodologies at top tech companies. We create scalable and dynamic NLP solutions, and implement end-to-end ML solutions into these systems as needed, ensuring the appropriate level of accuracy when deploying trained models over live production systems.
Our researchers and engineers love coming together across teams. They come from top universities such as Stanford University in EHS and EEFT, CUpertino and NYU Langone in HEP, Statute labs in NJM, NIPS Labs in MDL, USC IAF and TechCrunch in Singapore, etc.
The ideal candidate's favorite words are learning, innovation, scale and agility. You will leverage your existing technical expertise and bring prototypes from previous open-source efforts into our systems through contributions. In addition, you will leverage previous NLP related success experiences within successful BERT like JelinekB, TalkPort, DNNube or others, in order to transfer these techniques into current SOH and natural language understanders space as business priorities change and evolve.


Basic Qualifications
